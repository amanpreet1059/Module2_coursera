                <h2>Continental</h2>
                <p>
                    Chef Irfan tells us, "Continental food is something that is prepared in the continent of Europe. Essentially you 
		    won't see Chinese and Indian cuisines in a Continental platter, just Mediterranean and French food." Continental 
		    food refers to the delicacies consumed in European countries. The French, Italian and Spanish parts of Europe, 
	            all do 'continental' dishes which focus more on olive oil, wine, garlic and various herbs and spices.

                <p>
                    According to Chef Irfan, "Oriental food belongs to the Southeast Asian countries which include Chinese, Thai, Korean, Japanese, etc." 
		    The Oriental part of Asia covers a big chunk of Eastern Asia encompassing a wide range of culinary traditions. The Orient can stretch 
		    up to Philippines, Korean, Thailand, Indonesia, Mongolia, Japan, Vietnam and regions covering most of China. Oriental food generally 
		    uses dried ingredients like dry apricot and dry plums, while continental food does not use any of it.
